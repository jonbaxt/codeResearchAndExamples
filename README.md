# Code Research and Examples

This repo is designed to store notes that I've read up on the topics I am researching more about to learn and get better at being a developer.

Initially this started as basic questions with the text files, but has since been expanded to Toy Problems w/ solutions that I've been doing to practice JavaScript.

Since studying more, it has now expanded to even more in depth with a lot of guides and notes on the different technologies I am learning.

## Current structure of the Repo

Each Subject is divided into it's own folder. Since there are basic interview questions I've put them in it's own folder, anything JavaScript will be in the JavaScript folder etc.

Folders:
- Basic Questions
    - CSS
    - HTML
    - JavaScript
    - NodeServer
    - React
- GIT

- JavaScript
    - JavaScript in Depth
    
    - Toy Problems
    
    - YouDontKnowJS
- Redux

Each folder has it's own README for now.

## What's new:

-> Currently starting to learn more in depth about GIT commands.
