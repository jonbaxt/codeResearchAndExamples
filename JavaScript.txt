    - A mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another.

    - JavaScript itself is a prototype based language.
        --> All items in JavaScript are objects.
            ---> All items in C# are classes as another example of that.
        --> Since all items in JavaScript are objects, then prototypes are used to give functionality and methods to these objects. 
        --> You can then use this prototype method to add new methods to an existing object and since everything is objects, you can then do this for any part of JavaScript.
