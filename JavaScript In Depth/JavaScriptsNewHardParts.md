# Notes from JavaScript the New Hard Parts

## What happens when JavaScript executes (or runs) my code?

### Example of Code
```js
    const number = 4;
    function multBy3 (num) {
        const result = num*3;
        return result;
    }
    const myName = "Bob";
```
Inside memory of JavaScipt, there is a place to store the value of `number`.

`Function` as a word means in memory, go save in memory, this piece of functionality.

We do not go into a body of a function.
